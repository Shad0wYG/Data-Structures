Implement a C application for managing mutual investment funds. For this, you will use a double-linked list that contains pointers to elements of type MutualFund,
structure with the following attributes: mutual fund code (char*), mutual fund group (char*), risk level (int), net asset value (double), 
return of investment (float – percentage value).

1.	Create a double-linked list by inserting elements based on a selected criterion. The list must have at least 7 entries that are read from a file. (1 p)

2.	Write the function for printing all the mutual funds in the structure for both directions. (0.5 p)

3.	Write the function that counts how many mutual funds have the risk level greater than a given value, sent as a parameter. (1 p)

4.	Write the function that is determines the capital gain / loss for all the mutual funds. The function displays at the console the mutual fund code and the capital gain/loss by
applying the positive / negative return of investments to the net asset value attribute. (1 p)

5.	Write the function that searches in the double-linked list for the first mutual fund that has the net asset value greater than a threshold specified as a parameter. 
The mutual fund is returned in main() and the values are displayed. (1 p)

6.	Write the function for creating an array with all the elements that have the nominal return of investment higher than a limit specified as a parameter and are part of a
specified mutual fund group. The array doesn’t share HEAP memory space with the elements found in the double-linked list. The function is called in the main() and the
result (elements stored in the array) is displayed on the console. (1.5 p)
