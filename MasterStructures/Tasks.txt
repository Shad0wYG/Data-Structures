Hi, this is unrelated to the code itself, just making this to keep track of stuff I've done (marked with //)
and stuff I should be doing! 

Simple Lists:
- Create structure and node //
- Read //
- Print //
- Free memory //
bonuses: insert at the end of the list / make it circular and print it / sort the list (really tough btw) / convert to array


Double Lists:
- Create structure and node //
- Read //
- Print //
- Free memory //
bonuses: same as SL

*Ok so currently I cant delete both SL and DL and idk why, I'm assuming I must've done a shallow copy somewhere, idrk
but separately they work :shrug:
